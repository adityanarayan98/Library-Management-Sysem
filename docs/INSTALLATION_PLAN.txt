## 7. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Common Installation Problems

#### Python Version Issues
**Problem**: "Python 3.7+ is required but not found"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# If not 3.7+, download from python.org
# Ensure Python is added to PATH during installation
```

#### Dependency Installation Issues
**Problem**: "Failed to install packages from requirements.txt"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Upgrade pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install packages one by one to identify issues
pip install flask
pip install flask-login
pip install flask-wtf
# Continue with other packages
```

#### Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: "Unable to connect to database"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if instance directory exists
mkdir -p instance

# Check file permissions
# On Windows: Right-click instance folder > Properties > Security
# On Linux/macOS: chmod 755 instance

# Delete and recreate database if corrupted
rm -f instance/library.db
python run.py
```

#### Port Already in Use
**Problem**: "Port 5000 is already in use"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000  # Windows
lsof -i :5000  # macOS/Linux

# Kill the process or use different port
python run.py --port=5001
```

#### Permission Errors (Windows)
**Problem**: "Access denied" or "Permission denied"
**Solution**:
1. Run Command Prompt as Administrator
