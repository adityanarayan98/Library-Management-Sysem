   - **OPAC Interface** (Patrons): http://localhost:5001
4. **Log in** with the default credentials:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- **Check if port 5000 is in use** by other applications
- **Run as Administrator** if you get permission errors
- **Check antivirus** - it might block the .exe file

### Web Interface Not Accessible
- **Wait 5-10 seconds** after starting the application
- **Check firewall settings** - allow the application through
- **Try a different browser** if one doesn't work

### Build Process Fails
- **Check internet connection** - PyInstaller needs to download
- **Ensure Python is in PATH** - run `python --version` in command prompt
- **Free up disk space** - need at least 500 MB during build

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- No external connections except local web interface
- Database is stored locally on each computer
